# React's Reconciliation Process 
React's reconciliation process is at the heart of how React efficiently updates the user interface in response to changes in state or props. It's a key part of what makes React so powerful and performant.

## Render Virtual DOM ( Document Object Model ) : 
when you define your React components and render them to the DOM, React actually creates a lightweight representation of the DOM called the Virtual DOM. This Virtual DOM is a tree structure that mirrors the actual DOM
## State or Props Change :
When something changes in your application, such as a state or props update, React needs to determine what parts of the UI need to be updated.
## Reconciliation : 
React starts the reconciliation process. It compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one to determine what has changed. This process is efficient because React only updates the parts of the DOM that have actually changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
## Diffing Algorithm : 
React uses a "diffing" algorithm during reconciliation to identify the minimum number of operations needed to update the UI. It does this by recursively comparing elements in the old and new Virtual DOM trees.
## Updates :
Once React has determined what needs to be changed, it updates the actual DOM to reflect the changes. This might involve adding, removing, or updating DOM elements as necessary.
## Component Lifecycle Methods :
Throughout the reconciliation process, React also invokes certain lifecycle methods on your components, such as componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate, which allow you to perform additional logic before and after updates occur.
## Reconciliation Strategies:
React employs various strategies to optimize the reconciliation process, such as batching updates and using keys to help identify elements uniquely within lists.
